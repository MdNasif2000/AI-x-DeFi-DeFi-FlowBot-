# AI-x-DeFi-DeFi-FlowBot-
DeFi FlowBot is an AI agent that turns natural language into multi-step DeFi actions like token swaps, bridging, and liquidity provision â€” no buttons, no friction.

Managing DeFi positions across chains is complex â€” even simple tasks require juggling wallets, DEXes, bridges, and gas fees. DeFi FlowBot is a natural-language-powered agent that takes care of these workflows for you. Just say,
"Bridge 200 USDC from Ethereum to Starknet and stake it in JediSwap's LP"
â€¦and the agent will plan, simulate, and (eventually) execute the full sequence â€” from swap to bridge to staking.

During the hackathon, we focus on the AI system: the prompt processing, planning, and action simulation. Post-hackathon, we integrate full Web3 support with Starknet and AgentKit.

Multi-step breakdown (swap â†’ bridge â†’ LP)

Simulated action flow using AI Starknet Agent Kit or mocks

Modular agent architecture for plug-and-play integrations (BrianAI, Daydreams, etc.)

ðŸš€ Example Prompts
"Swap 100 DAI for ETH and bridge it to Starknet"

"Put 50% of my USDC into the best Starknet LP and the rest into lending"
