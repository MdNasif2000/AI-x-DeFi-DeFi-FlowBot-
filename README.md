# AI-x-DeFi-DeFi-FlowBot-
DeFi FlowBot is an AI agent that turns natural language into multi-step DeFi actions like token swaps, bridging, and liquidity provision — no buttons, no friction.

Managing DeFi positions across chains is complex — even simple tasks require juggling wallets, DEXes, bridges, and gas fees. DeFi FlowBot is a natural-language-powered agent that takes care of these workflows for you. Just say,
"Bridge 200 USDC from Ethereum to Starknet and stake it in JediSwap's LP"
…and the agent will plan, simulate, and (eventually) execute the full sequence — from swap to bridge to staking.

During the hackathon, we focus on the AI system: the prompt processing, planning, and action simulation. Post-hackathon, we integrate full Web3 support with Starknet and AgentKit.
